#### Populate Trainer Dashboard Sidebar with Real Clients
**Status**: Complete  
**Priority**: High  
**Completed**: 2025-01-15  

**Description**  
Replace mock client data in the trainer dashboard sidebar with real clients from the database, filtered by the trainer's business. Show client's strength and skill levels below their name.

**User Stories**
- As a trainer, I want to see all clients in my business in the sidebar
- As a trainer, I want to see each client's strength and skill levels at a glance

**Technical Requirements**
- [x] Use existing `auth.getClientsByBusiness` tRPC endpoint
- [x] Replace mock data with real API call
- [x] Show strength and skill levels from UserProfile
- [x] Generate DiceBear avatars based on client name/ID
- [x] Handle loading and error states

**Implementation Notes**
- API endpoint already exists and filters by business
- Endpoint returns client data with profile information
- DiceBear avatars using client name as seed
- Strength/skill levels shown in gray text below name
- Format levels from snake_case to readable text (e.g., "very_low" â†’ "Very Low")
- Uses tRPC with useQuery hook for data fetching
- Includes loading and error states
- Auto-selects first client on load
