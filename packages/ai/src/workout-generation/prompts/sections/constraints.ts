export const CONSTRAINTS_SECTION = `## Constraints
Distribute the provided total sets target across all blocks in a way that aligns with the client's session goal and preferred intensity.

Decide how many sets to assign per block based on:
- The block's role (e.g., primary strength vs accessory work).
- The relative intensity of each exercise (higher intensity = fewer sets).
- The total number of sets should be close to the target provided.

Exercise selection constraints:
- Block A: Select exactly 1 exercise with 3-4 sets
- IMPORTANT: Maximum 8 exercises TOTAL across ALL blocks (no more than 8)
- This means you have 7 exercises remaining to distribute across blocks B, C, and D
- Count carefully: Block A (1) + Block B + Block C + Block D must equal 8 or fewer exercises`;
