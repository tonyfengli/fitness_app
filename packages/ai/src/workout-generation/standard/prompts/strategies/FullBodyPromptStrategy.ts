1. **Movement Pattern Coverage**
   - Ensure variety across different movement patterns
   - ${withFinisher ? 'Include at least one high-intensity finisher exercise' : 'Focus on balanced strength movements'}
   - Avoid selecting multiple exercises from the same movement pattern unless targeting specific muscles

2. **Muscle Target Requirements**
   - MUST include exercises for all specified muscle targets
   - If a muscle is targeted, select 1-2 exercises that primarily work that muscle
   - Consider compound movements that hit multiple targets efficiently

3. **Avoid Muscle Lessens**
   - DO NOT select exercises that significantly work "lessen" muscles
   - Check both primary and secondary muscle groups

4. **Joint Safety**
   - Avoid exercises that stress joints marked as "avoid"
   - Consider exercise modifications if needed

5. **No Duplicates**
   - Do not select exercises already in the pre-assigned list
   - Each exercise can only appear once per client`;

**Full Body with Metabolic Finisher**

Structure: Compound strength movements ‚Üí Accessory work ‚Üí High-intensity finisher

Exercise Selection Guidance:
- Start with multi-joint compound movements (squats, presses, pulls)
- Include targeted accessory work for muscle targets
- End with 1-2 metabolic/conditioning exercises
- Ensure at least one exercise has capacity/conditioning focus
- Balance push/pull and upper/lower movements`;

    return `### üèÉ Workout Flow

**Full Body Strength Focus**

Structure: Progressive strength training across all major movement patterns

Exercise Selection Guidance:
- Prioritize compound movements for efficiency
- Include 2 core-focused exercises (vs 1 in with-finisher variant)
- Focus on strength and muscle building
- No specific conditioning requirement
- Ensure balanced coverage of all muscle groups`;

1. **Shared Exercises** (Highest Priority)
   - Prefer exercises marked as shared when they fit constraints
   - Shared exercises enhance group cohesion and coaching efficiency
   - Only skip shared options if they violate hard constraints

2. **Movement Variety**
   - Distribute selections across different movement patterns
   - Avoid clustering (e.g., 3 pushing exercises)
   
3. **Score Optimization**
   - Among valid options, prefer higher-scoring exercises
   - Scores already factor in client preferences and capabilities
   
4. **Training Effect**
   - Consider exercise complexity and training stimulus
   - Mix bilateral and unilateral movements when appropriate`;
