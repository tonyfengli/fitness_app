# Comprehensive Error Logging Summary

As requested, comprehensive error logging has been added throughout the group workout generation pipeline to aid debugging during the development of the group workouts epic.

## Key Areas Enhanced with Error Logging:

### 1. **generateGroupWorkoutBlueprint.ts**
- Added detailed phase tracking with timing metrics
- Enhanced console logging for each phase (Phase 1, 2, 2.5, and B)
- Added debug output for function tags to diagnose exercise categorization
- Comprehensive error catching with stack trace logging
- Integration with groupWorkoutTestDataLogger for persistent error tracking

### 2. **performGroupMergeScoring (mergeScores.ts)**
- Block-by-block processing logs with exercise counts
- Detailed overlap analysis showing shared exercises between clients
- Quality metrics for shared exercises
- Top exercises logging by group score
- Integration with test data logger for block scoring data

### 3. **visualizeGroupWorkout endpoint (training-session.ts)**
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error information
- Stack trace logging for debugging
- Error details saved to test data files
- Graceful error recovery with partial data saving

### 4. **Bug Fix: functionTags**
- Fixed critical bug where `function_tags` (snake_case) was being used instead of `functionTags` (camelCase)
- This was preventing exercises from being properly categorized into blocks
- Fixed in both generateGroupWorkoutBlueprint.ts and GroupWorkoutTemplateHandler.ts

## Console Output Structure:

The enhanced logging provides clear visual indicators:
- üéØ Entry points and key parameters
- üîÑ Processing steps
- ‚úÖ Successful completions with timing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings for missing data or suboptimal conditions
- ‚ùå Errors with detailed context
- üìä Summary statistics

## Test Data Integration:

All errors and warnings are automatically captured in the group workout test data files:
- `/session-test-data/group-workouts/group_[sessionId]_[timestamp].json`
- `/session-test-data/group-workouts/latest-group-workout.json`

## Next Steps:

With this comprehensive error logging in place, the next group workout session will provide detailed console output to diagnose:
1. Why exercises aren't being properly categorized by function tags
2. Why no shared exercises are being found between clients
3. Any other pipeline issues preventing successful blueprint generation

Run another group workout session to see the enhanced debugging output in action!
